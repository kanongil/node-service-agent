# service-agent for node.js

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/kanongil/node-service-agent/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

HTTP agent that connects to services defined in DNS SRV records, enabling transparent service discovery for any HTTP-based protocol.

Just add the agent to your request, and it will connect to the service.

## Usage

Using the popular `request` module:

```javascript
const ServiceAgent = require('service-agent');
const Request = require('request');

const request = Request.defaults({
  agentClass: ServiceAgent,
  agentOptions: { service:'_http._tcp.' },
  pool: {}
});

request('http://pkg.freebsd.org/', function(error, result, body) {
  â€¦
});
```

Note that you need to set the `pool` option whenever you specify the `service` when creating the agent. Otherwise, `request` will mix multiple services together.

### Options

 * `service`: Service designator to look for, prepended to the hostname. Defaults to `_http._tcp.`.

### Limitations

 * Services are not checked for connectivity. Currently, it will only select a weighted random service at the highest priority.
 * SSL is not supported.

Pull request to fix these issues are welcome.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install service-agent
```
